Data produced and analysed as part of the manuscript Blackman et al (submitted)

The following files have been produced as part of the manuscript: Environmental DNA consistently outperforms established methods for detection of quagga mussels, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis in flowing water 

1. qPCR data from mesocosm experiments for the detection of quagga mussel (D. r. bugensis)
2. qPCR data from field experiments for the detection of quagga mussel (D. r. bugensis)
3. Metabarcoding data generated using the COI primer pairs (Leray+Geller) (Leray et al 2013) for the 54 field samples and positives, including OTU ID and taxonomy generated from the MetaBEAT pipeline.
4. Sub-sample of those sites metabarcoding and qPCR for the detection of quagga mussel (D. r. bugensis)
